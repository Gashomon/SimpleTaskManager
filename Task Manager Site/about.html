                This section explains the webpage and its purpose.

                This is a small beginner project to practice web development. It uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
                It is designed as a template to practice back-end development so it needs to work completely 
                offline without needing to run any server so that other devices would not need to install anything 
                more so it runs on plain javascript just for the interactive things and to still be able to overlayed
                with the back-end stuff. 

                Although I still do not grasp how it can be done. Currently, it needs a local server to work.

                Each .html file is designed to be an import to the content portion of the index.html.
                All css styles are in the styles.css and all functions are bundled in the functions.js.
                Some experimental and refereshers are at the experimental codes.
                images and other type of used audio/video are in the media folder.

                It ended up as a hard-to-understand single webpage meant to import and load data from databases.
                You may do whatever modifications you want but there are also comments where backend code could be placed.
                If you have other recommendations for this implementation that would be most appreciated.
                
                Thanks for trying this project out!
