# **Task Management Webpage using HTML CSS and Javascript**

## Project Description
A simple webpage to practice back-end databases and **CRUD** Functions *(So far only CRD available)* 

Uses one main file *(index.html)* to run, imports the other htmls as content using AJAX GET requests.

(Experimental Codes are where I put fundamental practice stuffs and test codes that may be used someday)

It clearly lacks the visually appealing things and may not be the best implementation out there, but yes.
Any suggestion is appreciated.

## How To Run Things (My Way)
1. Download the Files.

2. Get VS Code.

3. Download Live Server Extension (or any other local server host)

4. Run index.html using live server
